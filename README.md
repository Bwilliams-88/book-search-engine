# Book Search Engine

## Description

This assignment was fairly challenging, not as difficult as the MVC assignment but pretty close to it for me. I was tasked with editing the starter code for a book searching / saving website using the MERN stack with a REACT front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.
